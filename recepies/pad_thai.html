    <h2>Pad Thai and why I love it</h2>
    <p>
      I have first discovered Pad Thai when on a trip to Ljubljana with my
      girlfriend Anja. The Mexican resteurant where we wanted to eat was busy
      and a Thai place was right around the corner. At first I didn't know what
      to order but I like nuts so I decided to go with Pad Thai that had chicken
      and peanuts. From the first bite I loved it, the crunch of the peanuts,
      the softness of the noodles combined with an amazing tasting souce that
      tastes nothing like I am used to.

    <h2>Making Pad Thai</h2>
    <p>Making Pad Thai is very quick and simple. Once you have all the igredients ready and chopped up it takes about 5 minutes to make. This is an easy "healthy" mid week meal. You can make it even faster by preparing some stuff in advance.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pad Thai Sauce</li>
        <li>Rice Noodles</li>

        <li>Chop up the peanuts, add with green onions</li>
